Provides outputs as:
- Standard Sound Outputs, +-5V
- Control Voltage Outputs 0-10V
- Through output (original wave)
- Total, Cumulative Sound Output, scaled to +-5V
- Total, Cumulative Control Voltage Output, scaled to 0-10V


# Getting Started

1. Build VCVRack from source, following the guide from here: https://vcvrack.com/manual/Building.html#building-rack or download the [Rack-SDK](https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack/issues/258#issuecomment-405119759), and a zipped build of [Rack](https://vcvrack.com/).

2. Follow the instructions for [Building Rack Plugins](https://vcvrack.com/manual/Building.html#building-rack-plugins), replacing the git repository with this repo: https://vcvrack.com/manual/Building.html#building-rack-plugins

Once completed, upon loading Rack, you should see the available plugins from this pack by searching for them using the Rack interface.
